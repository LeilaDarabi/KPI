# A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an organization is achieving key business objectives. 
Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets. 
- High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the enterprise, 
- while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, or support.
