A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an organization is achieving key business objectives. 
Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets. 
- High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the enterprise, 
- while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, or support.


Key Characteristics of KPIs:

- Specific: KPIs should be clear and specific to avoid misinterpretation.
- Measurable: They must be quantifiable so that performance can be tracked over time.
- Achievable: KPIs should be realistic and attainable to encourage improvement.
- Relevant: They must align with the business objectives and goals.
- Time-bound: KPIs should be set within a specific timeframe to track progress.
